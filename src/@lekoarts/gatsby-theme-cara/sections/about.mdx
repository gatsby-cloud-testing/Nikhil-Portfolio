SEO, which stands for Search Engine Optimisation), doesn’t seem to get old — it’s just different every year. Google changes its Search Algorithm and Ranking System every once in a while, adding new ranking factors or modifying existing ones. And since 2018, the page speed is one of them. I Am analyze the technical aspects of a website which is focus on data like crawl stats, page errors and rich snippets. In addition to technical analysis, I use Google Search Console for tracking the Website technical Aspects. I belive, if your website functionality, speed and design user friendly than no one can stop for top google SERP positions. 

The English language can not fully capture the depth and complexity of my thoughts. So I'm incorporating Emoji into my speech to better express myself. Winky face.
